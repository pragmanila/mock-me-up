# Mock Me Up

## Instructions:
 
 1. Create a website design mockup from the hand drawn wireframe. All the sections must be present and the layout must be the same.
 2. Create another mockup based from the hand drawn wireframe. This time, you are free to do any layout you wish as long as all the sections are present. *Optional, but a big plus*.
 3. Create your own logo. *Optional, but a big plus*.
 
## Rules/Pointers:
 - Submit your work in **PSD format** to info@pragmanila.com
 - You can separate the file for the logo if you created one.
 - There is no time limit. You can polish the design as you see fit before submitting. We will assume that the work you will be submitting will be your best.
 
## Key Factors to Consider:
  - Taking into consideration UX concepts and principles 
  - Color combination
  - Time taken to design vs. quality of work
